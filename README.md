Task 06 — Deep Fake / AI Street Interview

This repository contains the deliverables for Research Task 06 (SU OPT Research). The task was to create short, AI-generated interview videos (“deep fake” style) based on prior descriptive statistics work. The emphasis is on documenting workflow and attempts, not on creating polished media.

🎯 Objective

Convert prior dataset analysis (Netflix titles) into a 3-part interview format.

Use AI tools to simulate a studio-desk style interview with two consistent characters (Interviewer + Respondent).

Each video is limited to 8 seconds and contains one question and one answer.

Maintain consistency across all clips: same background, same people, same voices.

Document prompts, process, and ethics clearly.

🎥 Videos Produced

Clip 1: “What did you analyze?” (includes Het Trivedi introduction)

Clip 2: “Any key findings?”

Clip 3: “What’s the impact?”

All three are 8s, studio-style, with subtitles.

📜 Scripts (Q/A)
Clip 1 — What did you analyze?

Interviewer (0–3s): “What did you analyze in your project?”

Respondent (3–8s): “I’m Het Trivedi. I explored an 8.8-thousand-title Netflix dataset—ran descriptive stats and five deeper checks: growth trends, seasonal release patterns, market concentration, rating mix, and runtimes.”

Clip 2 — Any key findings?

Interviewer (0–3s): “Any key findings that stood out?”

Respondent (3–8s): “Yes—content drops peak in certain months, a few countries and genres dominate by HHI, and movies versus shows reveal very different rating distributions.”

Clip 3 — What’s the impact?

Interviewer (0–3s): “So what’s the real-world impact here?”

Respondent (3–8s): “Teams can time releases around peak months, diversify under-served genres, and fine-tune runtimes and seasons to better match audience expectations.”

🎬 AI Video Prompts

These prompts were given to the AI video generator to ensure two visible people (Interviewer + Respondent), consistent background, and consistent voices across all three clips.

General Setup (for all clips)

Background: Modern office studio with a desk, bookshelf, and soft warm lighting.

Interviewer: Male in blazer, seated left, holding a microphone.

Respondent: Het Trivedi, young professional in business-casual, seated right.

Camera framing: Both visible in a medium two-shot, close-up on respondent during answers.

Voices: Same two AI voices used throughout (one interviewer, one respondent).

Style: Subtle zoom, smooth transitions, professional interview feel.

Prompt for Clip 1 — What did you analyze?

“Generate an 8-second studio interview video with the same background, interviewer, and respondent used in all clips.

Dialogue:

Interviewer (0–3s): ‘What did you analyze in your project?’

Respondent (3–8s): ‘I’m Het Trivedi. I explored an 8.8-thousand-title Netflix dataset—ran descriptive stats and five deeper checks: growth trends, seasonal release patterns, market concentration, rating mix, and runtimes.’

The interviewer asks clearly, the respondent introduces themselves briefly and answers. Camera starts with two-shot, then cuts to close-up of the respondent.”

Prompt for Clip 2 — Any key findings?

“Generate an 8-second studio interview video using the same two people, same voices, and same office background as Clip 1.

Dialogue:

Interviewer (0–3s): ‘Any key findings that stood out?’

Respondent (3–8s): ‘Yes—content drops peak in certain months, a few countries and genres dominate by HHI, and movies versus shows reveal very different rating distributions.’

The respondent gestures lightly while answering. Camera alternates between two-shot and close-up.”

Prompt for Clip 3 — What’s the impact?

“Generate an 8-second studio interview video identical in setup, background, and characters to Clips 1 and 2.

Dialogue:

Interviewer (0–3s): ‘So what’s the real-world impact here?’

Respondent (3–8s): ‘Teams can time releases around peak months, diversify under-served genres, and fine-tune runtimes and seasons to better match audience expectations.’

The respondent leans slightly forward and smiles toward the end. Camera cuts between close-up and two-shot.”
